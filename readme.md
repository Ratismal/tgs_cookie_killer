The Great Suspender is a wonderful extension which suspends unused tabs to save on CPU and memory usage. Unfortunately, it creates some not-so-wonderful `gsScrollPos-X` cookies which completely break certain websites like YouTube and Google Maps.

This is a simple userscript that kills any cookie that it makes. Use it with Tampermonkey (Chrome) or Greasemonkey (Firefox, untested).
