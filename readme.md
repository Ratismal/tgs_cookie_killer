# The Great Suspender: Cookie Killer

The Great Suspender is a wonderful extension which suspends unused tabs to save on CPU and memory usage. Unfortunately, it creates some not-so-wonderful `gsScrollPos-X` cookies which completely break certain websites like YouTube and Google Maps.

This is a simple userscript that kills any cookie that it makes. Use it with Tampermonkey (Chrome) or Greasemonkey (Firefox, untested).

## Wow neato but I don't really trust you

That's fair. Check the [`cookiekiller.user.js`](https://github.com/Ratismal/tgs_cookie_killer/blob/master/cookiekiller.user.js) file to see exactly what this does and how it does it.

## Haha yes, sign me up!
